**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

### Key Features of GraphQL 

- **Declarative Data Fetching**: Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, GraphQL allows you to request exactly the data you need.
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: The GraphQL schema defines the capabilities of an API and allows clients to understand what they can query.
- **Single Endpoint**: With GraphQL, you can access all the data you need from a single endpoint.

### Example Query

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple query in GraphQL:

```graphql
{
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    age
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 29,
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "GraphQL Introduction",
          "content": "This is an introductory post about GraphQL."
        },
        {
          "title": "Advanced GraphQL",
          "content": "This post covers advanced topics in GraphQL."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
