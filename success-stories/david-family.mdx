David left home at 14 after a series of conflicts with his family. Living on the streets exposed him to numerous dangers and hardships. LOTSI's outreach team found him during one of their regular street visits.

### The Reconciliation Process

LOTSI's intervention included:
- Individual counseling for David
- Family therapy sessions
- Conflict resolution workshops
- Educational support after reunification

### Healing and Growth

The reconciliation process wasn't easy, but with LOTSI's support, both David and his family learned new ways to communicate and resolve conflicts.
