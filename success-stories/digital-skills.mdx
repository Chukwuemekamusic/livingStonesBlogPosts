Before joining LOTSI, Mary spent her days selling sachets of water on the streets of Lagos. She had never used a computer, but she always wondered about the people she saw working on laptops in caf√© windows.

### Learning Journey

Through LOTSI's digital skills program, Mary:
- Learned basic computer skills
- Completed web development training
- Participated in coding bootcamps
- Developed real projects for local businesses

### Career Launch

After completing her training, Mary secured an internship at a local tech company. She now works as a junior web developer and mentors other LOTSI beneficiaries interested in tech careers.

Mary continues to develop her skills and dreams of starting her own tech company to create opportunities for other young people from similar backgrounds.
