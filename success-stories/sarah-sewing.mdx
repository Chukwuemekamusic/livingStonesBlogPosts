Sarah's journey with LOTSI began in 2023 when she was struggling to support herself through odd jobs. Despite her challenging circumstances, she always had an eye for fashion and design.

### Skills Development

Through LOTSI's vocational training program, Sarah:
- Completed comprehensive tailoring training
- Learned business management basics
- Received mentorship from established tailors
- Got support for setting up her workshop

### Building a Business

With a microloan and business guidance from LOTSI, Sarah opened her small tailoring shop. Today, she employs two other young women and is known for her unique designs.
