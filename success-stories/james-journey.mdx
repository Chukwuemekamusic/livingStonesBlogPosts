When James first came to LOTSI in 2022, he had been living on the streets for three years. Despite the challenges he faced, his eyes lit up whenever he talked about his dream of becoming an engineer. "I used to watch construction workers and wonder if I could ever be like them," James recalls.

### The Turning Point

Through LOTSI's educational support program, James received:
- Basic education to catch up on missed schooling
- Intensive mathematics and science tutoring
- Mentorship from a professional engineer
- Support for university applications

### Transformation

Today, James is in his first year of Civil Engineering at the University of Lagos. "LOTSI didn't just help me get into university," he says. "They helped me believe in myself again."

"Education isn't just about books. It's about discovering who you can become. LOTSI showed me that my past doesn't define my future."

James now volunteers as a tutor for other LOTSI beneficiaries, helping them with mathematics and sharing his story of transformation.
