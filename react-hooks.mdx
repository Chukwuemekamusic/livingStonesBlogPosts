React introduced **Hooks** in version 16.8, which allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

- **useState** is a Hook that allows you to add React state to function components.
- **useEffect** is a Hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components. It's equivalent to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes.

Here is an example of using **useState**:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
