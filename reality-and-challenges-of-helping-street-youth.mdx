At **Livingstones off-the-street Initiative (LOTSI)**, we have spent years working with vulnerable youth living on the streets of Lagos. Our mission has always been clear: to protect, empower, and transform the lives of these young people, providing them with the skills and support they need to transition into stable, fulfilling lives. However, street life is filled with complexities, and helping these youth comes with its own set of unique challenges. Below, we explore both the **realities** of street life, the **successes** we’ve achieved, and the **setbacks** we’ve faced along the way.

## The Reality of Street Life

Street-connected youth face overwhelming odds every day. Exposed to the harsh realities of **violence**, **drug abuse**, **exploitation**, and **neglect**, many of these young individuals struggle to envision a life beyond the streets. For them, survival is the top priority, leaving little room for planning a future.

Despite this grim backdrop, we have seen moments of incredible resilience and transformation. Many of the boys and girls we work with are eager to build better lives for themselves. However, the **instability** of street life often leads to **inconsistent engagement**. While some youth attend our programs and show great progress, others find it difficult to maintain focus, regularly slipping back into the street life they are so familiar with.

Take, for instance, **Samuel**, one of the first youth we reconciled with his family. His initial excitement about reconnecting with loved ones was followed by difficulties in adjusting to family life after years of independence on the streets. Unfortunately, like many others, Samuel returned to the streets for a time before LOTSI intervened again.

## Successes and Setbacks

Despite the obstacles, we are proud of the **impact** we have made:

- **Weekly meetings** consistently draw in an average of 35-50 boys, offering them a safe space for physical activities, vocational training, and psychosocial support.
- Our **vocational programs** have equipped youth with skills in areas like cobbling, tie-dye, and barbing, allowing some to re-enter society with practical, marketable skills.

However, our successes often come with setbacks. One of our biggest challenges is **family reconciliation**. While some youth successfully reconnect with their families, others face rejection or find it difficult to adapt to structured family life after spending years surviving independently on the streets. Many families are either unwilling or unable to hold their children who have been indoctrinated with the street mindset.

Another recurring challenge is the **consistency** of youth engagement in our programs. While some of the boys and girls we work with demonstrate a strong desire to learn and grow, they often struggle to commit to long-term plans. The freedom of street life, combined with the challenges they face, makes it difficult for them to maintain stable jobs or remain in vocational programs.

## Evolving Approaches to Overcome Challenges

At LOTSI, we understand that addressing these realities requires continuous **adaptation** and **evolution**. Over the years, we have refined our approach to better meet the needs of the youth we serve, focusing on **holistic support** that combines vocational training, education, and emotional development.

One of the ways we are addressing the challenge of **inconsistent engagement** is through **mentoring**. Each youth is paired with a mentor who provides ongoing guidance and emotional support, helping them stay focused and motivated. Our mentoring program has proven to be a valuable tool for building **trust** and encouraging youth to remain committed to their personal growth.

To enhance our **vocational training** efforts, we have also **partnered with organizations** like **GIZ** to offer structured **life skills programs**. These partnerships have allowed us to expand the range of opportunities available to the youth and provide them with essential life skills that go beyond just vocational training, helping them navigate the challenges of adult life.

Additionally, we have incorporated more **community outreach** and **family counseling** into our programs. We work closely with families to prepare them for the challenges of reconciliation and reintegration, helping to create a more supportive environment for the youth once they return home.

## Looking Ahead: Building a Brighter Future

While the road is long and the challenges are many, **LOTSI** remains committed to transforming the lives of street-connected youth. We believe in the potential of every young person we work with, even in the face of setbacks. Our work is evolving every day as we develop new strategies to better serve the youth, and we invite others to join us in this mission.

Through the support of our partners, volunteers, and donors, we can continue to expand our programs and help more young people build brighter, more stable futures.

Together, we can overcome the obstacles and create lasting change for these vulnerable youth.
